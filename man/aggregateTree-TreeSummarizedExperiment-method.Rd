  selectedNodes = NULL, aggFun = colSums, start = 1, end = NULL,
  by = "row", format = "TreeSummarizedExperiment")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{TreeSummarizedExperiment object}

\item{selectedLevel}{level to select nodes from}

\item{selectedNodes}{used to set states on individual nodes to define a cut on the tree}

\item{aggFun}{aggregate function to use, by default colSums if by="row", rowSums if by="col"}

\item{start, end}{indices to filter nodes}

\item{by}{"row" to aggregate the TreeIndex on rowData, "col" to aggregate TreeIndex on colData}

\item{format}{return format can be one of "counts" or "TreeSummarizedExperiment"}
